# SudokuSolver
This project sought to design a sudoku solver. Users are able to input their own puzzle from a document named "puzzle.txt". This puzzle can be changed from the command window. Then, users are able to quickly solve the Sudoku Puzzle using recursive backtracking. The approximate runtimes for the machine are under 20 milliseconds.

# Getting Started
Users should have C command tools installed before executing this program. For windows, users should have MinGW installed on their machines and should be comfortable with its interface. OS X users should have the Xcode command line tools installed and should be comfortable with their interface.

# Running Tests
Users should submit a Sudoku puzzle in the file named "Puzzle.txt". There are example puzzles in the folder "Puzzles". Users must input blank spaces as '0' and input a space or tab in between the numbers. Users should then follow the window in order to solve their puzzle.
